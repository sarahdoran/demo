		<h1 class= "header"> Bonjour. </h1> 
		<p>His background is shrouded in mystery, his powers are supernatural and his reputation is whispered about among men. He goes by different names, but folks just call him The Magician.</p>
		
		<p>One night not so long ago, he appeared from a place between space and time. The Magician stepped into this world, materializing in a cloud of crystal stars and soft pink smoke. Some say he is the guardian angel of all resident DJ’s, others claim he’s a former airline pilot who crashed an afterparty – some say it’s just an illusion, a well performed hoax. But is it really?</p>
		
		<p>Everywhere The Magician goes, there’s music in the air. People come under his spell and dance like there’s no tomorrow. Lost in a purple haze, transfixed in a flurry of white doves. He makes clubbers float through disco heaven and takes them around the house on a magic carpet ride. Behind his green translucent eyes, there’s an unlimited knowledge of the musical past, present and future.</p> 

		<p>The Magician shifts shapes in a heartbeat and appears all throughout the world. One moment he’s sprinkling space dust on the Balearic isles, next he’s performing his rhythmic hocus pocus between the smoke and mirrors of a glitzy nightclub in Santiago or Moscow. When he vanishes, the only proof of his existence The Magician leaves are his ‘magic tapes’, a sample of his magnetising skills.</p> 

		<p>No magic wand or top hat needed, it’s all in his wizardly mind and flexible fingertips. The Magician has more than one trick up his sleeve though; word has it that the mystery man is working on a special formula to transform the musical workings of others – and don’t be amazed if, one day, he perfects his craft and creates his very own brand of spectral sounds.</P> 

		<p>Forget that Potter kid, Gandalf or Merlin, and get ready for a new chapter in the world of wonder and bewitchment. Get ready for The Magician.</p>
